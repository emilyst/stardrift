/// Velocity Verlet integrator
///
/// A second-order symplectic integrator that provides excellent energy conservation
/// for Hamiltonian systems. Widely used in molecular dynamics and orbital mechanics,
/// it offers the best balance between computational cost and conservation properties
/// for most applications.
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// The Velocity Verlet algorithm uses a clever splitting that maintains symplecticity:
///
/// ```text
/// Stage 1: Half-step velocity update
///   a(t) = F(x(t))/m
///   v(t+dt/2) = v(t) + a(t) * dt/2
///
/// Stage 2: Full-step position update
///   x(t+dt) = x(t) + v(t+dt/2) * dt
///
/// Stage 3: Complete velocity update
///   a(t+dt) = F(x(t+dt))/m
///   v(t+dt) = v(t+dt/2) + a(t+dt) * dt/2
/// ```
///
/// Equivalently (as implemented):
/// 1. a(t) = F(x(t))/m
/// 2. x(t+dt) = x(t) + v(t)*dt + 0.5*a(t)*dt²
/// 3. a(t+dt) = F(x(t+dt))/m
/// 4. v(t+dt) = v(t) + 0.5*(a(t) + a(t+dt))*dt
///
/// # Mathematical Properties
///
/// - **Order of accuracy**: O(dt²) local truncation error
/// - **Symplectic**: Preserves phase space volume exactly (det J = 1)
/// - **Time-reversible**: Forward and backward integration are symmetric
/// - **Force evaluations**: 1 per timestep (acceleration stored and reused)
/// - **Self-starting**: No previous values needed
///
/// # Energy Behavior
///
/// - **Energy conservation**: Excellent - bounded oscillations without drift
/// - **Modified Hamiltonian**: Conserves H̃ = H + O(dt²) exactly
/// - **Long-term stability**: No secular drift in energy or angular momentum
/// - **Symplectic structure**: Preserves all Poincaré invariants
///
/// The energy error remains bounded for exponentially long times, making
/// this ideal for long-duration simulations of conservative systems.
///
/// # Computational Cost
///
/// Extremely efficient with only 1 force evaluation per timestep:
/// - Same cost as Symplectic Euler but with O(dt²) vs O(dt) accuracy
/// - 4× cheaper than RK4 or PEFRL
/// - The stored acceleration can be reused for the next timestep
///
/// # Comparison with Other Methods
///
/// | Property      | Velocity Verlet | RK4         | PEFRL       | Symplectic Euler |
/// |---------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
/// | Order         | 2               | 4           | 4           | 1                |
/// | Force evals   | 1               | 4           | 4           | 1                |
/// | Symplectic    | Yes             | No          | Yes         | Yes              |
/// | Energy drift  | Bounded         | Linear      | Bounded     | Bounded          |
/// | Best for      | General purpose | Short sims  | High accuracy| Simple problems |
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// **Ideal for:**
/// - Molecular dynamics simulations
/// - Gravitational N-body problems
/// - Solar system and asteroid dynamics
/// - Any Hamiltonian system where energy conservation matters
/// - Real-time physics simulations (games, visualizations)
///
/// **Consider alternatives:**
/// - Use PEFRL when 4th-order accuracy is essential
/// - Use RK4 for non-conservative systems or short simulations
/// - Use Symplectic Euler for educational purposes or extreme simplicity
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// This implementation recalculates the acceleration at each step. Some
/// implementations store the acceleration between steps for efficiency,
/// but this requires careful state management. The current approach is
/// simpler and more robust.
